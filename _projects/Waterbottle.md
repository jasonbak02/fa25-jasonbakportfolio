## Overview
In MAE 2250 Introduction to Mechanical Design, I was assigned to pick an everyday object that I frequently use and make a detailed render of it in Solidworks. As someone who had little to no CAD experience (at the time), this task seemed pretty daunting. I ended up modeling my everyday water bottle in SolidWorks to practice realistic part modeling and threading features. I actually learned a ton about the process of designing something from scratch and was able to use it in my summer internship where I used Solidworks to design fluid systems. 


## Design Features
- Accurately modeled threads for the cap
- Realistic bottle contours and grip texture
- Proper wall thickness for manufacturing
