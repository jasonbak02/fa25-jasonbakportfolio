Hi, my name is Jason Bak and I'm a junior at Cornell University from New York. I'm currently studying mechanical engineering with a minor in business; I'm interested in working with fluid machines, specifically hydraulics. On campus, I'm involved in research, my church community, American Cancer Society, and Taiwanese Student Association. Some relevant courses I have taken are Statics, Engineering Dynamics, Fluid Dynamics, and System Dynamics. On this site, you will be able to see some of my projects that I have worked on in school and professionally as well as my resume.
